# Automating Civil Engineering Calculations

Calculations of slab and beam parameters have been simplified.

## How to run files in this repository

* Open .ipynb file using "Google colab". 
* In google colab upload the tables related to that notebook
* Start running cells 
* Enter inputs when asked and at last you will have output

## Tables in this repository

They are Indian standard values of different parameters.
I have used those parameters for Calculations purposes.

## What I have achieved

* I have successfully calculated all the necessary parameters needed.
* Every calculation is based on Indian Standard protocols.
* The program has eased dreary calculations.
